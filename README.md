# Protein-Analysis

Input:
The excel sheets contain data collected for several proteins for days D0, D1, D2, D3 and D4 for two different cell types N18 and N3.

This program uses Pandas library to iterate over data for p<0.05 for N18 and p<0.05 N3 and,
1. Finds all proteins that decrease in Day4 compared with Day0 for both N3 and N18 cell types.
2. Finds all proteins that increase in Day4 compared with Day0 for both N3 and N18 cell types.
